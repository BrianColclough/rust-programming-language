Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your codeâ€™s organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes collectively referred to as the module system, include:

1. Packages: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates.
2. Crates: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable.
3. Modules and use: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths.
4. Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module.

# Packages and Crates

A crate is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time. Crates can contain modules and modules can be defined in other files that get compiled with the crate.
